1. **You**: hello
2. **deepseek**: Hello! How can I assist you with your programming or coding questions today? ðŸ˜Š
3. **You**: im getting this error when i test the PUT in the api/contact {
  "error": "UnauthorizedError: No authorization token was found"
}
4. **deepseek**: The error `"UnauthorizedError: No authorization token was found"` indicates that your API endpoint is protected by authentication, but you're not providing a valid authorization token when making the PUT request to `/api/contact`.

## How to Fix This

Here are the steps to resolve this issue:

### 1. Check if Your API Requires Authentication
First, verify that this endpoint indeed requires authentication. If it shouldn't require auth, you might need to adjust your server-side route configuration.

### 2. Include an Authorization Token
If authentication is required, you need to include a valid token in your request headers. Typically this looks like:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your-token-here>
```

### 3. How to Add the Authorization Header

**Using Postman:**
1. Go to the "Authorization" tab
2. Select "Bearer Token" as the type
3. Paste your JWT or access token in the token field

**Using cURL:**
```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key":"value"}' http://your-api/api/contact
```

**Using JavaScript (fetch):**
```javascript
fetch('/api/contact', {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(yourData)
})
```

### 4. Verify Your Token is Valid
If you're still getting errors after adding the token:
- Ensure the token hasn't expired
- Check if it has the required permissions/scopes
- Verify it's properly formatted (no extra spaces, correct "Bearer " prefix)

### 5. Check Server-Side Middleware
If you control the API, examine your authentication middleware (like Passport.js, JWT verification, etc.) to ensure:
- It's properly configured for this route
- The header name matches what's expected (some APIs use custom headers)

Would you like me to provide more specific guidance based on your particular authentication system (JWT, OAuth, etc.) or framework (Express.js, Django, etc.)?
5. **You**: ill be using thunderbolt
6. **deepseek**: Great! Thunderbolt is a versatile high-speed interface that can be used for data transfer, external displays, or connecting peripherals. To assist you effectively, I'll need more details about your specific use case. Here are some common scenarios and how to proceed:

### **1. Connecting Thunderbolt Devices**  
   - Ensure your device (laptop/desktop) supports Thunderbolt (3/4 or USB4).  
   - Use a certified Thunderbolt cable for best performance.  
   - Plug in the deviceâ€”it should auto-detect (for storage, displays, docks, etc.).  

### **2. Data Transfer (Storage/NVMe Enclosures)**  
   - Format the drive if new (e.g., APFS for macOS, NTFS/exFAT for cross-platform).  
   - Check speeds: Thunderbolt 3/4 supports up to **40 Gbps** (faster than USB 3.2).  

### **3. External GPU (eGPU) Setup**  
   - Compatible OS: macOS (limited support) or Windows.  
   - Install GPU drivers *before* connecting the eGPU enclosure.  

### **4. Multi-Monitor Setup**  
   - Thunderbolt supports **Daisy Chaining**: Connect monitors in series if they support it.  
   - Ensure your GPU can handle the resolution/refresh rate.  

### **5. Debugging Issues**  
   - **Device not recognized?** Try:  
     - Updating firmware/drivers.  
     - Testing different ports/cables.  
     - Checking system logs (`System Report` on macOS, `Device Manager` on Windows).  

### **Example Code (If Working with Thunderbolt in Software)**  
If you're developing software that interacts with Thunderbolt devices:  

- **Linux**: Use `lsusb`, `lspci`, or `sysfs` to check connected devices:  
  ```bash
  lspci | grep Thunderbolt
  ```

- **macOS**: Check system report:  
  ```bash
  system_profiler SPThunderboltDataType
  ```
